What a year it's been, let's take a look back at my project's #development!

<i>(p.s. This is a long read, but please give it a chance. It's very exciting and provides an insight to my apps development. Also there are new content updates provided later on)</i>


<b>UI:</b> The User Interface is a major factor to consider when developing a mobile application, you need to strive to hit certain criteria while overcoming many challenges. The criteria I set included: **_Understanding_**, **_Freshness_**, **_Customization_**, **_Purposeful_**, and **_Integrated_**. Some of these criteria may not be standard, but with the goal of creating something truly unique, something rules need to be broken.

<b>UX:</b> The User Experience is just as important as the UI, if the interface look amazing but interaction feels off, the entire app feels off. This section also involves a certain criteria, with items including: **_Frictionless/Fluid_**, **_Understanding_**, **_Inclusive_**, and **_Integrated_**. You might have noticed that some of these criterion match the UI criterion, this is intended.

<b>UI/UX:</b> A product feels most complete when its Interface and Experience are tightly **_Integrated_**. When a app opens a secondary page, most apps go for a direct approach where the interface simply fades in, and for most cases this is an acceptable approach. But when the user wishes to close that secondary page, they need to find the "close" or "back" button, which can add friction. But let's say that instead of a simple fade-in animation, the interface instead animates in from the bottom of the screen. This allows for the introduction of new experiences that provide **_Purpose_** and feels natural to the user, where instead of the user needing to learn how to use and navigate your product, they **_Understand_** that if they pull that same interface downwards, it'll go back down and out of the screen. This concept is similar to how iOS and Android handle system gestures, moving away from a button, and now opting for a flick up gesture that minimizes an app back into its icon on the homescreen. When the UI and the UX are made with each-other in mind, the product experience is elevated much more than otherwise possible and ensures everything feels **_Frictionless_**.


#####<b>Updates:</b>##### While I'm not going to provide my ENTIRE commit log from the months of changes, I understand you want me to... but, I will highlight some major changes and additions with some images attached.

<b>1) Song Page:</b> It's finally here! With the database now properly hooked up, and user content added for testing, when a user taps on a song it will now open a dedicated page for that song. The page includes data such as the Length, Genres, and number of people recommending that particular song. Action buttons such as "Like", "Share" and quick-link buttons that allow users to listen to the full song on their favourite streaming services have been added. A song preview is also provided where the user can have a quick taste of what the song they're looking at is like. A comment section will also be active which allows music fans alike to chat about their favourite songs.

<b>2) User Accounts:</b> Users can now "Create an Account" if they're new, or "Login" if they're returning. User accounts are available directly through Spectrum, or through other methods (Apple, Google, Microsoft), with "Sign in w/ Phone Number" planned. It was exciting, and at times painful (but hey, what are challenges for?) to finally get this fundamental feature working and tested.

<b>3) Details:</b> Animations have been added to switches and other UI elements, furthering the Understanding of what particular elements are doing. Some devices that have rounded displays also have custom support that makes certain UI Elements follow the natural curve of the display, to feel more native to the device it's running on.

<b>4) Refinements:</b> As always, refinements will be an ongoing process. Both the User Interface and User Experience have gone through multiple iterations of change, from font sizes and container padding, to major redesigns. These changes can be small, but minor issues can add up quickly.
